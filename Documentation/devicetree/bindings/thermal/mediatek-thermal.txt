* Mediatek Thermal

This describes the device tree binding for the Mediatek thermal controller
which measures the on-SoC temperatures. This device does not have its own ADC,
instead it directly controls the AUXADC via AHB bus accesses. For this reason
this device needs phandles to the AUXADC. Also it controls a mux in the
apmixedsys register space via AHB bus accesses, so a phandle to the APMIXEDSYS
is also needed.

There is another hardware engine, SVS (Smart Voltage Scaling) which shares the
same block of banked registers with Mediatek thermal controller. Hence the
driver of SVS is integrated with the driver of Mediatek thermal controller. The
properties required by SVS engine are optional for Mediatek thermal controller.

Required properties:
- compatible: "mediatek,mt8173-thermal"
- reg: Address range of the thermal controller
- interrupts: IRQ for the thermal controller
- clocks, clock-names: Clocks needed for the thermal controller. required
                       clocks are:
		       "therm":	 Main clock needed for register access
		       "auxadc": The AUXADC clock
- resets: Reference to the reset controller controlling the thermal controller.
- mediatek,auxadc: A phandle to the AUXADC which the thermal controller uses
- mediatek,apmixedsys: A phandle to the APMIXEDSYS controller.
- #thermal-sensor-cells : Should be 0. See ./thermal.txt for a description.

Optional properties:
- clocks, clock-names: Clocks that are optional for the thermal controller.
	       Specify to enable SVS engine.
	       "svs_pll": The PLL clock should be switched to during
			  initialization stage of SVS engine.
	       "svs_mux": The MUX clock controls the clock input of SVS engine.
- nvmem-cells: A list of phandles to the calibration data provided by a nvmem
	       device. If unspecified default values shall be used. The SVS
	       engine will be disabled if no SVS calibration data is specified.
- nvmem-cell-names: Should be "calibration-data" and "svs-calibration-data"
- bank[0,1]-supply: Regulator for each SVS bank

Example:

	thermal: thermal@1100b000 {
		#thermal-sensor-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-thermal";
		reg = <0 0x1100b000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 70 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		clocks = <&pericfg CLK_PERI_THERM>, <&pericfg CLK_PERI_AUXADC>,
			 <&topckgen CLK_TOP_SYSPLL1_D2>, <&topckgen CLK_TOP_AXI_SEL>;
		clock-names = "therm", "auxadc", "svs_pll", "svs_mux";
		resets = <&pericfg MT8173_PERI_THERM_SW_RST>;
		reset-names = "therm";
		mediatek,auxadc = <&auxadc>;
		mediatek,apmixedsys = <&apmixedsys>;
		nvmem-cells = <&thermal_calibration_data>, <&svs-calibration>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "calibration-data", "svs-calibration-data";
		bank0-supply = <&mt6397_vpca15_reg>;
		bank1-supply = <&da9211_vcpu_reg>;
	};
