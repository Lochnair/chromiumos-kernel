Qualcomm Universal Peripheral (QUP) I2C controller

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be:
   * "qcom,i2c-qup-v1.1.1" for 8660, 8960 and 8064.
   * "qcom,i2c-qup-v2.1.1" for 8974 v1.
   * "qcom,i2c-qup-v2.2.1" for 8974 v2 and later.
 - reg: Should contain QUP register address and length.
 - interrupts: Should contain I2C interrupt.

 - clocks: A list of phandles + clock-specifiers, one for each entry in
   clock-names.
 - clock-names: Should contain:
   * "core" for the core clock
   * "iface" for the AHB clock

 - #address-cells: Should be <1> Address cells for i2c device address
 - #size-cells: Should be <0> as i2c addresses have no size component

Optional properties:
 - clock-frequency: Should specify the desired i2c bus clock frequency in Hz,
                    defaults to 100kHz if omitted.
 - qup-clock-frequency: Should specify the desired i2c qup clock frequency in
                    Hz. If omitted, then the frequency configured by bootloader
		    will be used.
 - noise-reject-scl: Should specify the desired scl noise reject value (max value 3)
 - noise-reject-sda: Should specify the desired sda noise reject value (max value 3)
 - duty-cycle: Specify clock dividers for i2c bus duty-cycle.
		Bits 16:8 should have the high timer divider value (min value
		is 7). Bits 7:0 should have the Fast/Standard (FS) divider
		value (min value is 7). Computing the correct divider values
		for a specific duty cycle requires using the clock-frequency
		property above. In other words, do not change clock-frequency
		without recomputing duty-cycle.

Child nodes should conform to i2c bus binding.

Example:

i2c@f9924000 {
	compatible = "qcom,i2c-qup-v2.2.1";
	reg = <0xf9924000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 96 0>;

	clocks = <&gcc GCC_BLSP1_QUP2_I2C_APPS_CLK>, <&gcc GCC_BLSP1_AHB_CLK>;
	clock-names = "core", "iface";

	clock-frequency = <355000>;

	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	noise-reject-scl = <0x1>;
	noise-reject-sda = <0x1>;
	duty-cycle = <0x5edb>;
};
