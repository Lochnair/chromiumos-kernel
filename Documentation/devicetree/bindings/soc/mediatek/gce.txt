MediaTek GCE
===============

The Global Command Engine (GCE) is used to help read/write registers with
critical time limitation, such as updating display configuration during the
vblank. The GCE can be used to implement the Command Queue (CMDQ) driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "mediatek,mt8173-gce"
- reg: Address range of the GCE unit
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the GCE block
- clock: Clocks according to the common clock binding
- clock-names: Must be "gce" to stand for GCE clock

Required properties for a client device:
- mediatek,gce: Should point to the respective GCE block

Example:

	gce: gce@10212000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-gce";
		reg = <0 0x10212000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 135 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		clocks = <&infracfg CLK_INFRA_GCE>;
		clock-names = "gce";
	};

Example for a client device:

	mmsys: clock-controller@14000000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-mmsys";
		mediatek,gce = <&gce>;
		...
	};
