* MAX77620 Power management IC.

Required properties:
-------------------
- compatible: Must be "maxim,max77620".
- reg: I2C device address.
- interrupt-controller: MAX77620 has internal interrupt controller which takes the
  interrupt request from internal sub-blocks like RTC, regulators, GPIOs as well
  as external input.
- #interrupt-cells: Should be set to 2 for IRQ number and flags.
  The first cell is the IRQ number. IRQ numbers for different interrupt source
  of MAX77620 are defined at dt-bindings/mfd/max77620.h
  The second cell is the flags, encoded as the trigger masks from binding document
	interrupts.txt, using dt-bindings/irq.

Optional properties:
-------------------

Optional submodules and their properties:
=======================================

Flexible power sequence configuration
====================================
The flexible power sequencer allows each regulator to power up under hardware or
software control.  This sub-node configures the FPS of the device. The device
has 3 FPS represented as FPS0, FPS1 and FPS2. The FPS sub-node name is "fps" and
their children each have a register property to represent the FPS number.

The properties for the fps child nodes:
Required properties:
	-reg: FPS numbers (i.e. 0, 1, 2 for FPS0, FPS1 and FPS2 respectively)
Optional properties:
	-maxim,fps-time-period: U32 for the FPS time period in uS.  Must be one
			of: 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2560, 5120
	-maxim,fps-enable-input: FPS enable source like EN0, EN1 or SW. The
			macros are defined on dt-bindings/mfd/max77620.h for
			different enable source.
				FPS_EN_SRC_EN0 for EN0 enable source.
				FPS_EN_SRC_EN1 for En1 enable source.
				FPS_EN_SRC_SW for SW based control.
	-maxim,fps-sw-enable: Boolean, applicable if maxim,fps-enable-input is
			set to FPS_EN_SRC_SW. If this property is present, then
			FPS is enabled.  Otherwise, the FPS is disabled.
	-maxim,enable-sleep: Enable sleep when the external control goes from
			HIGH to LOW.
	-maxim,enable-global-lpm: Enable global LPM when the external control goes from
			HIGH to LOW.

Pinmux and GPIO:
===============
The device has 8 GPIO pins which can be configured as GPIO as well as the
special IO functions and are programmable through the standard pinctrl/gpio
device tree representations (see pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt and
gpio/gpio.txt)

For the pinmux configuration, the pins must be one of: gpio0, gpio1, gpio2,
gpio3, gpio4, gpio5, gpio6, gpio7

			GPIO2 and GPIO3.
		- maxim,fps-source: FPS source for the gpios. Valid
			values are FPS_SRC_0, FPS_SRC_1, FPS_SRC_2
			and FPS_SRC_NONE.
			Absence of this property will leave the pin on
			default.
		- maxim,fps-power-up-period: Power up period/slot on
			given FPS. Valid values are 0 to 7.
		- maxim,fps-power-down-period: Power down period/slot
			on given FPS. Valid values are 0 to 7.

Regulators:

required if regulator functionality is needed.

The following are properties of the regulator sub-node:

    Optional properties:

    Optional sub-nodes for regulators:
    ---------------------------------
	The subnodes name is the name of regulator and it must be one of:
	sd[0-3], ldo[0-8]

	Each sub-node should contain the constraints and initialization
	information for that regulator. See regulator.txt for a description
	of standard properties for these sub-nodes.
	Additional optional custom properties  are listed below.
