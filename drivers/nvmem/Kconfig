	  Support for NVMEM(Non Volatile Memory) devices like EEPROM, EFUSES...

	  This framework is designed to provide a generic interface to NVMEM
	  from both the Linux Kernel and the userspace.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called nvmem_core.

	  If unsure, say no.

	select REGMAP_MMIO
	help
	  This is a driver to access hardware related data like sensor
	  calibration, HDMI impedance etc.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called efuse-mtk.

	  Say y here to enable QFPROM support. The QFPROM provides access
	  functions for QFPROM data to rest of the drivers via nvmem interface.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called nvmem_qfprom.

	  This is a driver for the 'security ID' available on various Allwinner
	  devices.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called nvmem_sunxi_sid.
